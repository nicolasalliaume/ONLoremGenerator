ONLoremGenerator
================

Generates Lorem Ipsum via command line.

Just copy lorem.sh in your drive, and use it:

```
lorem.sh [paragraphs]
```

[paragraphs] can be a number from 1 to 5. If no paragraphs is specified, it will generate 5.

Rock & roll
----------------

Add an alias in your ~/.bash_profile like:

```
lorem='/path/to/lorem.sh'
```

and now you can use it just as 'lorem' from anywhere you want.
